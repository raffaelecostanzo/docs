= Application Discovery

Control Center is meant to be a central management solution for Vaadin apps deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
If you want to manage a Vaadin app with Control Center, use the Discovery view to add the application to Control Center.
Before an application can be properly managed by Control Center, some preparations need to be done first.

== Prepare an app for discovery

First, you must add the `control-center-starter` dependency to your Vaadin app.
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>control-center-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Create a `bootstrap.yaml` file with the app name and config reload enabled.
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: control-center-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      reload:
        enabled: true
----

Build a docker image of your app with an appropriate `Dockerfile` file.

[source,shell]
----
docker build -t vaadin/example:0.1.1 .
----

== Deploy and adopt a Vaadin app

Once you have a docker image of your app ready, the next step is to deploy your app using Control Center.
In the Application Discovery view, click on "Deploy". This will open the application deployment dialog.

Fill in the text fields with the data for the app. 

- In the "Application name" field, use the same name as the one in the `bootstrap.yml` file.
- In the "Image" field, remember to use the correct tag.
- In "Hostname" fill a hostname that can is resolvable by the browser (just like the Keycloak hostname).
- The "Use a secure connection" checkbox is optional. It determines whether a self-signed certificate will be created for the app or not.

NOTE: if the version in the image tag is `latest`, Control Center will pull the image from the public registry.

One you click "Confirm", Control Center will create a deployment using your app's docker image and make it available at the specified hostname as soon as possible.

You can adopt the app at any moment so it is available for selection in the app selection dropdown. This will allow you to select the app for management in other parts of Control Center, like user management.
To adopt an orphaned app, just select it and click on "Adopt".

When you no longer wish to have Control Center manage an app, just select it and click "Delete".

== Scale an app

Once an app has been deployed, it is easy to scale it, be it up or down. Just select the app to scale and click on "Scale". The scale dialog will show up. Write down the number of replicas you  wish your cluster to have and click "Confirm". Your app will then be automatically scaled to the desired number of replicas.
